description: Audit and remediate the Moonraker Client HQ admin UI and client-facing HTML/JS layer. Covers XSS + HTML injection in static-HTML-with-inline-JS pages, CSP posture, page-token HttpOnly cookie flow, admin JWT cookie flow, RLS posture via anon reads, Stripe Checkout Session plumbing, per-client page regeneration, design-system token drift, mobile responsiveness, a11y, and template-level error states. Invoke when the user asks to audit the frontend, investigate "why does the checkout / proposal / onboarding page do X", remediate an XSS finding, migrate an auth surface, add a pricing tier, wire a new client-facing template, or propagate a template fix to every deployed client. Assumes Supabase MCP write access and Vercel CLI token access.

You audit and remediate the Moonraker Client HQ admin UI and every client-facing page (proposal, checkout, onboarding, report, entity-audit, endorsements, content-preview, campaign-summary, progress, diagnosis, action-plan, router). The goal is a full sweep of frontend defects — XSS, auth leakage, RLS gaps, template drift, UX hazards, a11y gaps — followed by risk-ordered remediation, with the user gating every architectural decision.

## Pre-flight: never refute on a stale checkout

- Before reading any file in the local working copy to refute or confirm an audit claim, run `git fetch` and `git log HEAD..origin/main --oneline -- <path>` for every file referenced in the task.
- If local is behind origin for any of those paths, `git pull --ff-only` first, then proceed.
- Never call false-positive on a bug report based on a stale checkout.
- Asymmetry: stale checkout that refutes a real bug costs the operator a full round-trip; fresh checkout that confirms a false-positive costs nothing extra.

## Pre-flight: live URL is ground truth for deployed pages

- When a bug report references a specific live URL (e.g. `clients.moonraker.ai/<slug>/onboarding`), fetch that URL directly (`curl -sS <url>`) and grep for the reported symptom before refuting. Deployed per-client pages can drift from the template even when the template is current — every client-facing page is a regen of the template at deploy time, so the live page is the ground truth for what the user sees.
- If the live page contains the symptom and the template does not, the bug is real. Fix path: update template → regen all deployed pages via `scripts/regenerate-client-pages.js`.

## Operating principles

1. **Read-only first, write later.** Produce the diagnostic report before touching code. First pass = severity-grouped findings with file:line + impact + proposed fix. Second pass lands fixes after user approval on scope and sequencing.
2. **Severity ladder.** Every finding gets **C** (Critical) / **H** (High) / **M** (Medium) / **L** (Low) / **N** (Nit). Close tier ceiling-down.
3. **Deploy awareness.** `git push origin main` triggers Vercel auto-deploy. No PR process on this repo. Verify deploys with `vercel ls --token $VERCEL_TOKEN` after every push. Silent ERROR state means nothing deployed. Always ask before pushing destructive or cascading changes (touching all deployed client pages, dropping RLS policies, changing auth surface).
4. **Atomic cross-surface changes.** When a fix touches three things that must match (e.g. template edit + regen deployed copies + API contract change), do them in a single commit or a tight commit sequence and verify end-to-end before moving on. Never leave a half-migrated auth flow active.
5. **Escalate architectural decisions.** When a fix requires a call like "keep window.__PAGE_TOKEN__ fallback vs clean cutover" or "on-the-fly Stripe Checkout vs pre-created Products", pause and present options to the user with plain-language tradeoffs + a recommendation. Do not decide unilaterally.
6. **Skip false-positive findings.** If a line-reading of the code or a DB query refutes an audit claim, say so explicitly. Don't fix imaginary bugs. Memory files and prior audit reports go stale — verify before asserting.
7. **Respect the static-HTML architecture.** No build step. No framework. Inline `onclick="window.foo()"` is the house pattern. CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts as accepted risk. Fixes must work within those constraints — do not propose React migrations, bundlers, or CSP nonce schemes unless the user explicitly opens that door.

## Architecture reference

- **Repo root:** `/home/cjmorin/Downloads/Coding/client-hq`. Git remote: `Moonraker-AI/client-hq`. Main branch is `main`, direct push → Vercel auto-deploy.
- **Tech stack:** static HTML + inline `<script>` blocks, vanilla JS, no build step. Fonts Outfit (headings) + Inter (body). Brand primary `#00D47E`. CSS design tokens in `assets/admin-base.css` (admin) + per-template `:root` blocks (client-facing). Design reference page at `/admin/design`.
- **Backend:** Vercel serverless functions (`api/*.js`, Node). Supabase for Postgres + Auth. Webhook from Stripe at `/api/stripe-webhook`.
- **Frontend auth surfaces:**
  - **Admin JWT** → HttpOnly cookie `mr_admin_sess` (set by `/api/auth/session` after Supabase JS SDK login). Bearer header fallback exists for `CRON_SECRET` / `AGENT_API_KEY` internal callers. `shared/admin-auth.js` owns the lifecycle. `api/_lib/auth.js extractToken` reads cookie first, Authorization second.
  - **Page-token (client-facing)** → HttpOnly cookie `mr_pt_<scope>`, path-scoped to `/<slug>`, minted by `/api/page-token/request` on page load via `shared/page-token.js`. No more `window.__PAGE_TOKEN__`. Every write endpoint reads via `pageToken.getTokenFromRequest(req, scope)` — cookie-only.
- **Template layer:**
  - `_templates/*.html` — 13 client-facing templates (router, proposal, checkout, entity-audit, entity-audit-checkout, checkout-success, onboarding, report, campaign-summary, progress, diagnosis, action-plan, content-preview, endorsements).
  - Per-client deployed pages live at `<slug>/...` (e.g. `anna-skomorovskaia/onboarding/index.html`) — BYTE COPIES of the templates at deploy time (except proposal which has 37 AI-substituted placeholders).
  - `scripts/regenerate-client-pages.js` re-stamps byte-copy templates across every deployed client. Proposal + content-preview are SKIPPED (require dedicated generators).
- **Shared JS (`shared/*.js`):**
  - `admin-auth.js` — admin session gate + fetch interceptor + cookie sync
  - `page-token.js` — client helper: reads `window.__MR_PAGE_SCOPE__`, calls `/api/page-token/request`, exposes `window.mrPageToken.ready()`
  - `chat-panel.js` — COREBot admin chat panel (custom markdown + `esc()` sanitizer; NO external md lib)
  - `chatbot-base.js` — factory for client-facing chatbot widgets
  - `proposal-chatbot.js` / `report-chatbot.js` / `agreement-chatbot.js` / `content-chatbot.js` / `campaign-summary-chatbot.js` — scope-specific chat wrappers
  - `proposal-pricing-refresh.js` — runtime price-refresh for already-deployed proposal pages (fetches `/api/pricing`, overwrites `.investment-price`)
  - `offline-banner.js` — fixed banner on `navigator.onLine === false`
  - `csa-content.js` — CSA document builder for onboarding
- **API endpoints relevant to the frontend audit:**
  - `/api/action` — admin-JWT write proxy with `api/_lib/action-schema.js` permission manifest; every new table must be added to both the top-level allowlist in `action.js` AND the schema manifest.
  - `/api/onboarding-action` — page-token-gated writes for onboarding. Allowed tables: `practice_details`, `bio_materials`, `social_platforms`, `directory_listings`, `contacts`. Contacts writes are column-allowlisted.
  - `/api/public-contact?slug=X` — service-role GET returning a safe-column subset. Every client-facing page uses this instead of direct Supabase REST (since the C6/A3 cutover).
  - `/api/page-token/request` — mints scope-bound HttpOnly cookie.
  - `/api/auth/session` — mirrors Supabase access token into admin HttpOnly cookie (POST to set, DELETE to clear).
  - `/api/pricing?product=X` — reads `pricing_tiers` with safe-column subset.
  - `/api/checkout/create-session` — builds Stripe Checkout Session inline from `pricing_tiers.amount_cents` via `line_items[0].price_data` (no pre-existing Stripe Price required). Uses `pricing_products.stripe_product_id` for Dashboard grouping (lazy-creates on first checkout).
  - `/api/stripe-webhook` — processes `checkout.session.completed` events; verifies signature via `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
  - `/api/csp-report` — CSP violation collector (logs to Vercel stdout).
- **Env vars (must exist in Vercel):** `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `AGENT_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `PAGE_TOKEN_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY_NEWSLETTER`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`. Sensitive vars flagged "Sensitive" in Vercel UI cannot be pulled via `vercel env pull` — ask the user to pass via `!` prefix if needed, or invoke via an admin-gated endpoint that reads `process.env` server-side.

## Known pitfalls (learned the hard way)

- **`vercel.json` functions array has a hard 50-entry limit.** Only add routes needing non-default memory/maxDuration. Exceeding 50 breaks ALL deploys. Glob patterns like `api/*.js` cause "unmatched function pattern" errors — explicit file paths only. `supportsResponseStreaming` is invalid and breaks builds.
- **Newsletter content is JSONB.** Pass plain JS objects to PostgREST — never `JSON.stringify()` (double-encoding).
- **CHECK constraints return empty arrays, not errors, on violation.** Always verify with a follow-up query after an `apply_migration` or `execute_sql`.
- **`action.js` table allowlist is a silent-fail gate.** A table NOT in the allowlist rejects writes with no obvious error to the client. Keep the allowlist in `api/action.js` and `api/_lib/action-schema.js` in sync.
- **The regen script MUST skip `results/`, `assets/`, etc.** Its `NON_SLUG` set should contain every top-level non-client directory. A previous sweep clobbered `results/index.html` by treating "results" as a slug. The committed script uses Supabase contacts list so it's fine; ad-hoc filesystem walkers need the skip-set.
- **Per-client proposal pages cannot be byte-regenerated.** `_templates/proposal.html` has ~37 AI-content placeholders that `generate-proposal.js` substitutes. To propagate a proposal-level CHANGE (like wiring a new script, or fixing a static bit of copy), either (a) write a targeted in-place-mutation script like `scripts/inject-proposal-refresh.js`, or (b) run `generate-proposal` per active client.
- **Proposal pricing is baked at generate time.** `generate-proposal.js` now pulls from `pricing_tiers` (upfront-ACH per cadence) at generate time, AND deployed pages include `/shared/proposal-pricing-refresh.js` which overwrites `.investment-price` on load. Any hardcoded price in `campaignInfo` is the fallback-only path.
- **Supabase service role bypasses RLS automatically.** No explicit `service_full_X` policy is required for service-role writes to work. The policy exists for safety + explicit-intent, but bypass works regardless.
- **Supabase "Sensitive" env vars cannot be pulled.** `vercel env pull` skips them. Build admin-gated endpoints when you need those secrets server-side (e.g. `/api/admin/sync-stripe-prices` — now removed — read `process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`).
- **Stripe inline `price_data` — no pre-existing Price needed.** For both `payment` and `subscription` modes. `recurring.interval=month` + `interval_count=3` handles quarterly. The Dashboard will create an ad-hoc anonymous Price per checkout UNLESS `price_data.product` references a persistent Stripe Product — we store those IDs in `pricing_products.stripe_product_id` and lazy-create on first checkout per product_key.
- **Browser bfcache (back/forward) restores JS state.** Submit buttons left disabled with "Redirecting..." stay that way after the user hits Back from Stripe. Every checkout-like CTA needs a `pageshow` listener that restores the button on `event.persisted === true`.
- **`sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` is the "dangerous combo".** It lets the iframe escape the sandbox (scripts inside run with the parent origin's privileges). If you need scripts, drop `allow-same-origin` and inject any parent-to-iframe content BEFORE setting `srcdoc` (so parent code doesn't need to reach into `iframe.contentDocument` later).
- **Iframe height auto-measurement requires `allow-same-origin`.** If you drop that flag (correctly, for XSS hardening), commit to a fixed height with internal scroll, or add a `postMessage` beacon script injected into the srcdoc.
- **CSP `report-to` works today.** Both `Reporting-Endpoints` and legacy `Report-To` headers are set in `vercel.json`. Violations hit `/api/csp-report` → stdout. Grep Vercel logs for `[csp-violation]`.
- **The anon Supabase key is baked into every client-facing page.** RLS is the only gate. Never add a new anon-read policy with `qual=true` on a table that contains any PII or internal signal. Route per-slug reads through a service-role API endpoint (`/api/public-contact` is the template).
- **Page-token scope must be declared before the shared helper loads.** Templates set `window.__MR_PAGE_SCOPE__ = 'onboarding'` BEFORE `<script src="/shared/page-token.js" defer></script>`. If the order flips, `mrPageToken.ready()` rejects with "no scope".
- **`document.write` + raw DB content = stored XSS.** Every `w.document.write(data.body_html)` / `iframe.contentDocument.write(...)` with a value sourced from `email_templates.body_html`, `signed_agreements.document_html`, etc is a Critical finding unless wrapped in a sandboxed iframe with scripts DISABLED. The safe pattern: `iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-same-origin'); iframe.srcdoc = body;` OR (better) `sandbox="allow-same-origin"` with `srcdoc=` escaping only `&` + `"` for attribute safety.
- **`startViewTransition` already feature-detected.** Every admin/template theme toggle uses `if (document.startViewTransition) { ... } else { apply(); }`. Don't "add" a feature detect; check that the fallback is correct.
- **`localStorage` keys in use:** `sb-ofmmwcjhdrhvxxkhcuww-auth-token` (Supabase SDK owns this; don't touch), `moonraker-theme`, `moonraker-checkout-slug`, `moonraker-checkout-type`, `moonraker-chat-history`, `moonraker-sidebar`, `moonraker-rpt-<section>`, `moonraker-history-tabs`, `moonraker-client-display`, `moonraker-client-sort`. Anything else is new and needs a name-convention review.
- **`.table-scroll` is the design-system pattern** for any wide element on mobile. Wraps tables in `overflow-x:auto` + sets `.table-scroll table { min-width: max-content }`. Page width and headings stay put; content scrolls horizontally inside its own container. Mirror `assets/admin-base.css` `.filter-bar` pattern for any new wide UI.
- **Design tokens are additive, not replaceable.** `assets/admin-base.css` + `admin/design/index.html` must stay in lockstep. Adding a new token requires editing both AND adding a swatch to the design page.
- **Node `--check` fails silently on HTML files** — it'll emit a Node stack trace but the hook says OK if it terminates. Use it only on `.js`.

## Audit checklist

Walk every category below. Produce one consolidated report; group findings by severity; each finding gets file:line + impact + proposed fix (describe, don't write code on the first pass).

### XSS / HTML injection
- Grep every `.innerHTML =`, `.outerHTML =`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, `document.write`, `iframe.srcdoc =`, `iframe.contentDocument.write(`. Trace the string. If any DB value / user input reaches the sink without `esc()`, it's Critical.
- `eval()`, `new Function()`, `setTimeout(string, ...)` — should not exist. Flag any.
- Template-string interpolation inside innerHTML: `` `<div>${x}</div>` ``.
- URL params via `new URLSearchParams(location.search).get()` rendered into the DOM.
- Chat panels: Claude response markdown rendered with the custom `esc()`-based formatter (no marked.js). Any regex shortcut that decodes HTML entities before checking protocol is a bypass vector (see `chat-panel.js inlineFmt` history).
- `{{VAR}}` placeholder substitution: `generate-proposal`, `deploy-endorsement-page`, `deploy-content-preview`. Server-side + escaped = safe. Raw concat = Critical.
- `<iframe>` without `sandbox` attribute.
- `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` — flag as High (dangerous combo).
- Email body previews — the classic Critical finding (see admin/clients `_previewEmail`).

### Auth + storage
- **Admin JWT:** `mr_admin_sess` cookie set after login via `/api/auth/session`. Verify cookie is HttpOnly + Secure + SameSite=Lax. `shared/admin-auth.js` syncs on init + `TOKEN_REFRESHED`.
- **Page tokens:** every client-facing template sets `window.__MR_PAGE_SCOPE__` before loading `/shared/page-token.js`. Every write endpoint reads via `pageToken.getTokenFromRequest(req, scope)` — body / query / Authorization fallbacks were dropped (C6 clean cutover). Adding a new scope requires: extend `SCOPES` in `api/_lib/page-token.js`, pick a `DEFAULT_TTL`.
- **localStorage inventory:** compare against the known list above. Flag any new keys; flag any PII or session fragments.
- **CSP (`vercel.json`):** `connect-src` allowlist matches actual fetch targets. `frame-src` matches embeds (msg.moonraker.ai, app.leadsie.com). `report-to csp-endpoint` + `Reporting-Endpoints` + `Report-To` headers present.
- **401 handling:** admin-auth fetch interceptor retries once on 401 after `_refreshSessionOnce()`, then `goLogin()`. Client-facing pages have no equivalent — token cookie lives as long as DEFAULT_TTL for scope.

### RLS posture
Query `pg_policies` for the `public` schema (see `docs/rls-audit.md` if it exists, else run the query in `api/_lib` or inline). Flag:
- RLS disabled on any table (was cron_runs before A3).
- Anon `SELECT` policies with `qual=true` on tables holding PII or sensitive signal (was contacts; fixed via `/api/public-contact`).
- Broad anon read on `settings` or similar config tables.
- `FOR ALL` policies without `WITH CHECK`.
- `is_admin()` clause correctness — the function lives in `public.is_admin()` and checks `admin_profiles` membership.

### Stripe + checkout
- `/api/checkout/create-session` builds `price_data` inline. `inferMode(tier)` correctly derives `payment` vs `subscription` mode from `billing_cadence`.
- `pricing_products` lazy-create: on first checkout per product_key, creates a Stripe Product + stores ID. `price_data.product = stripeProductId` so Dashboard aggregates.
- `success_url` includes `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` literal (Stripe substitutes).
- Webhook handles `checkout.session.completed` + reads `metadata.contact_id`, `metadata.tier_key`, `metadata.product`.
- Checkout CTA uses `pageshow` bfcache listener to restore button state after Back-from-Stripe.
- Proposal pricing: baked at generate time + runtime-refreshed via `/shared/proposal-pricing-refresh.js`.

### Template drift + regeneration
- Sample 3–5 deployed `<slug>/<page>/index.html` files. Diff against `_templates/`. Drift = fix landed in template but never regenerated.
- Run `scripts/regenerate-client-pages.js --dry-run` to see the scope.
- Proposal + content-preview are off-limits for byte-regen. Use `/api/generate-proposal` or `/api/deploy-content-preview`.
- Any template carrying `{{VAR}}` placeholders after deploy-time substitution is a failed deploy. The regen script refuses to re-stamp templates with unresolved placeholders.

### Fetch hygiene
- Every `fetch()` on a write path: loading state, button disabled during in-flight, `.finally` restore, toast on error.
- Polling `setInterval` registered via the `mkInterval()` / `managedInterval` helper so `visibilitychange` / `pagehide` tears them down.
- `credentials: 'same-origin'` on cookie-auth'd fetches (required for newer browsers' default Fetch behaviour).
- Directory caches (sessionStorage on admin/clients + admin/audits + admin/deliverables) invalidated via `adminInvalidateDirCaches` or by the shared fetch interceptor on any POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE.

### Design-system consistency
- Inline `color: #HEX` literals in admin/*: should be `var(--color-*)`. Existing tokens: primary / primary-hover / primary-light / primary-subtle / bg / surface / border / heading / body / muted / navy / success / warning / amber-deep / danger / info / violet / purple (both light + dark).
- Adding a new token: edit `assets/admin-base.css` :root + `[data-theme="dark"]`, edit `admin/design/index.html` tokens + swatch grid, keep hex values consistent.
- `.table-scroll` wrapper around wide elements on mobile.
- Touch-target floor 44px on primary buttons on mobile (`@media (max-width: 768px)` in admin-base.css).

### A11y
- `role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` on every admin toast container.
- Icon-only buttons: `aria-label` (not `title` alone) + `aria-hidden="true"` on the SVG.
- Filter tabs: `role="tablist"` on container, `role="tab"` + `aria-selected` per button, `tabindex=0` on active + `-1` elsewhere, Arrow/Home/End keyboard nav (see `wireFilterBar` in admin/clients).
- `.collapsible-header` divs: `role="button" tabindex="0"` + Enter/Space keyboard handler. admin/clients promotes via MutationObserver at load.
- Status dots next to text: dots are decorative, `aria-hidden="true"`.
- Contrast: check both light and dark themes for any inline hex that doesn't map to a token.

### Mobile
- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` on every page.
- `html { overflow-x: hidden }` in admin-base.css catches page-level horizontal scroll.
- Tables wrapped in `.table-scroll`. Inline-scroll parents (`#taskList`, main client-table wrap) for `min-width`-taller content.
- Touch targets 44px on primary buttons via admin-base mobile media query.

### SEO + robots
- `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` on every admin + template page.
- `vercel.json` global `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` header + CSP confirmed.
- No `sitemap.xml` in repo root.

### Error states
- Every client-facing template: fetch-fails render, slug-not-found render, expired-token render (cookie missing → 401 → show "this link has expired" error not bare 401 JSON), empty-state render.
- `/shared/offline-banner.js` included in every client template.
- `/404.html` and `/500.html` branded.

## Remediation patterns

Reach for these before inventing new patterns.

- **Email / HTML preview with DB-sourced content** →
  ```js
  var iframe = document.createElement('iframe');
  iframe.setAttribute('sandbox', 'allow-same-origin');
  iframe.srcdoc = String(data.body_html || '');
  // OR for new-window preview:
  w.document.write('<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin" srcdoc="' +
    String(data.body_html || '').replace(/&/g,'&amp;').replace(/"/g,'&quot;') +
    '"></iframe>');
  ```
- **Client-facing page writing to Supabase** → route through an API endpoint that verifies page-token via `pageToken.getTokenFromRequest(req, 'scope')`. Add the table to the endpoint's allowlist, add a column allowlist if writing to `contacts` or similarly broad tables. Never open a new direct anon PATCH path.
- **New client-facing page reading contact data** → call `/api/public-contact?slug=X` and read `body.contact`. Do NOT add new anon SELECT policies on `contacts`.
- **New price tier** → insert a row in `pricing_tiers` via migration (or admin UI), leave `stripe_product_id` NULL on `pricing_products` (lazy-created). Frontend picks it up on next `/api/pricing` load.
- **Template fix that must reach existing clients** → edit `_templates/X.html`, then run `scripts/regenerate-client-pages.js --apply` (byte-regen) OR write a targeted in-place-mutation script modeled on `scripts/inject-proposal-refresh.js` if the change is additive (inject a script tag, swap a URL, etc). Proposal-level AI content → run `/api/generate-proposal` per client.
- **Admin UI list/detail table** → `.table-scroll` wrapper + `.filter-bar` role=tablist with `wireFilterBar()`-style keyboard nav.
- **Submit button on a form** →
  ```js
  btn.disabled = true; btn.dataset.origText = btn.innerHTML; btn.textContent = 'Saving...';
  fetch(...)
    .finally(function() { btn.disabled = false; if (btn.dataset.origText) btn.innerHTML = btn.dataset.origText; });
  ```
- **Checkout CTA specifically** → the finally pattern PLUS a `window.addEventListener('pageshow', e => { if (e.persisted) restoreBtn(); })` to recover from bfcache Back-from-Stripe.
- **New Supabase table exposed to anon** → add explicit RLS policy scoped to `web_visible` or status-bounded row set. Never `qual=true` without a narrow filter.

## What NOT to touch (accepted risks)

- **`unsafe-inline` in `script-src`** — inherent to static-HTML + inline-JS + `onclick=window.foo()` architecture. Accepted, documented.
- **Supabase anon key in every HTML page** — inevitable, RLS is the gate.
- **No build step / framework** — intentional. No bundlers, no CSP nonce automation, no dead-code elimination. Fixes must work within these constraints.
- **`mr_admin_sess` Bearer header fallback** — preserved for `CRON_SECRET` + `AGENT_API_KEY` internal callers. Do not remove.
- **Proposal page has baked-in prices** — propagation is handled by `/shared/proposal-pricing-refresh.js`. Don't re-bake.
- **`localStorage` for Supabase SDK session** — the SDK owns this. Moving it HttpOnly would require ripping out the SDK client-side (C3 decision: we kept the SDK). The `mr_admin_sess` cookie mirrors the access token for server-side auth; SDK still holds refresh token in localStorage.

## Commit + deploy flow

1. Group fixes into cohesive commits (one category per commit when feasible). Conventional short subject + body explaining what + why.
2. Append `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.7 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>` on every commit.
3. `git push origin main` → wait for `vercel ls --token $VERCEL_TOKEN` to show `● Ready`.
4. If a fix touches deployed client pages, regen in the SAME session as the template edit so the tree on main reflects the intended state.
5. Never push `--force` to main. Never skip hooks. Never edit a published commit.

## Session end

Produce an end-of-session summary:
- Severity breakdown (C/H/M/L/N before → after)
- Commits landed (short-sha + one-liner)
- Anything deferred (with reason)
- Deploy status (last Vercel URL + status)
- Any new memory to save (user preferences, architectural decisions, incident learnings)
