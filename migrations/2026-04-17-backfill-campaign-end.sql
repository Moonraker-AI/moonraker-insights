-- Backfills contacts.campaign_end for active/onboarding/prospect clients
-- where it's currently null. Derives the end date from campaign_start +
-- a plan_type-based interval:
--
--   plan_type = 'quarterly' -> 3 months
--   plan_type = 'annual'    -> 12 months
--   plan_type = 'monthly'   -> 12 months (no fixed contract end; treat as
--                                         annual for reporting purposes)
--   plan_type IS NULL       -> 12 months (default assumption)
--
-- Skips any row where campaign_start is null (cannot derive an end without
-- a start). Skips any row where campaign_end is already set (idempotent).
-- Operates only on active/onboarding/prospect contacts; leads and lost
-- clients don't need a campaign end.
